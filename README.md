# What 2 do

 What 2 do is an application based on Android Mobile. Also, we are using Django server and SQLite.
 This application services a lot of function such as Main-focus, To-do List, GPS, TIME, Notification Alarm, Share, and so on.
 
 These all functions can use on the lock-screen.
 
 [ What 2 do ] is so powerful schedular application for dramatic people.
 
# so, we confidently say, "JUST USE IT, RIGHT NOW. THEN YOU'LL HAVE PERFECT DAYS."
